3. **Basic Config** - Configuring agents with tools
4. **Basic Context** - Adding user context to agents
5. **Basic Output** - Structured data output
6. **Basic Handoffs** - Agents that work together
7. **Basic Dynamic Instructions** - Agents that adapt to users
8. **Basic Cloning** - Creating variations of agents
9. **Running** - Multi-turn conversations
10. **Streaming Raw Response** - Real-time responses
11. **Run Item And Agents Events** - Tracking agent actions
12. **Hosted Tools** - Using OpenAI's built-in tools
13. **Function Tools** - Creating custom tools
14. **Custom Function Tools** - Advanced tool creation
15. **Agents As Tools** - Using agents as tools for other agents
16. **Customizing Handoffs** - Advanced agent collaboration
17. **Customizing Guardrails** - Safety features
18. **Customizing Output** - Complex structured data
19. **Customizing Models** - Using different AI models

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- UV package manager (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the OpenAI Agents SDK:
   ```
   uv add openai-agents dotenv
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Examples

Navigate to any example directory and run the Python file:

```
cd 01Helloworld
uv run helloworld.py
```

## üß† Learning Path

We recommend going through the examples in order, as each one builds on concepts from previous examples:

1. Start with **Hello World** to create your first AI assistant
2. Move on to **Basic Config** to learn about tools
3. Try **Basic Context** to personalize responses
4. Explore **Basic Handoffs** to create collaborative agents
5. Continue with more advanced examples as you get comfortable

## üìù Documentation

Each example includes:
- A README.md file explaining the concepts
- Commented code showing how to implement the features
- Instructions for running and modifying the example
