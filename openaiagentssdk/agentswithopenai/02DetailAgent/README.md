# üß© Detail Agent Example

## ü§ñ What Is This?

This example shows how to create smarter AI agents that can work together and follow rules! It's like having a team of robot helpers who each have special jobs.

## üß† How It Works

In this example, we create three different agents:
1. A **Guardrail Agent** that checks if questions are about homework
2. A **Math Tutor Agent** that helps with math problems
3. A **History Tutor Agent** that helps with history questions

Then we create a **Triage Agent** that decides which helper to use based on your question!

## üìù The Code Explained

```python
from agents import Agent, InputGuardrail, GuardrailFunctionOutput, Runner
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agents import set_default_openai_key
import os

load_dotenv()

openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
set_default_openai_key(openai_api_key)

# First we create a special checker that looks at homework questions
class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking about homework.",
    output_type=HomeworkOutput,
)

# Then we create our specialist tutor agents
math_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning at each step and include examples",
)

history_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
    instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries. Explain important events and context clearly.",
)

# This function checks if a question is homework-related
async def homework_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=not final_output.is_homework,
    )

# Finally, we create our main agent that decides which helper to use
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="You determine which agent to use based on the user's homework question",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent],
    input_guardrails=[
        InputGuardrail(guardrail_function=homework_guardrail),
    ],
)
```

### üîç Let's Break It Down:

1. **Guardrails**: These are like safety checks that make sure the AI only answers appropriate questions. In this case, we check if the question is homework-related.
2. **Handoffs**: These let one AI agent pass a question to another agent who's better at answering it. Our triage agent can hand off to either the math or history tutor.
3. **Triage**: This means sorting questions and sending them to the right helper based on the subject matter.

## üöÄ How It Works in Action:

The main function demonstrates how the system works:

```python
async def main():
    # First example - homework question about history
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "who was the first president of the united states?")
    print("History question result:", result.final_output)
    
    # This would fail because it is not a homework question
    # result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "What is life?")
    # print("Philosophy homework result:", result.final_output)

    # Second example - modified to be a homework question about philosophy
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "For my philosophy homework, can you explain how ancient Greek philosophers viewed the meaning of life?")
    print("Philosophy homework result:", result.final_output)
```

1. First, we ask a history question about the first US president
2. Then we have a commented-out example that would fail the guardrail check
3. Finally, we ask a philosophy homework question that passes the guardrail

## üéÆ Try It Yourself! üöÄ
1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   uv add openai-agents python-dotenv pydantic
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   uv run detailagent.py
   ```
4. Try modifying the guardrail to check for different conditions!

## üß† What You'll Learn

From this example, you'll understand:
- How to create multiple agents that work together
- How to use guardrails to check inputs and filter out inappropriate questions
- How to make agents hand off tasks to other specialist agents
- How to create structured outputs with Pydantic models
- How to use async functions with AI agents

## üåà Next Steps

Once you've mastered this example, try creating your own system of specialized agents that can work together to solve more complex problems!

Happy coding! üéâ
