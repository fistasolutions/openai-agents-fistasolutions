# üîß Hosted Tools Example

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine giving your robot friend superpowers to search the internet and look through documents! This code shows how to use OpenAI's built-in tools that let your AI assistant search the web for current information and find relevant content in your documents.

Now, let's go step by step!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Magic Key üóùÔ∏è
```python
from agentswithopenai import Agent, FileSearchTool, Runner, WebSearchTool, set_default_openai_key
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import asyncio

load_dotenv()
openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
vector_store_id = os.environ.get("VECTOR_STORE_ID", "your_vector_store_id_here")
```
The AI assistant needs a magic key (API key) to work properly, plus a special ID for where your documents are stored.

This code finds these keys hidden in a secret file (.env) and unlocks them.

## Step 2: Creating a Research Assistant with Hosted Tools ü§ñ
```python
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Research Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You are a helpful research assistant that can search the web and retrieve information 
    from documents to provide comprehensive answers.
    
    When answering questions:
    1. Use the WebSearchTool to find current information from the internet
    2. Use the FileSearchTool to find relevant information from stored documents
    3. Combine information from both sources to provide a complete answer
    4. Always cite your sources
    5. If the information is not available or unclear, be honest about limitations
    """,
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        FileSearchTool(
            max_num_results=3,
            vector_store_ids=[vector_store_id],
        ),
    ],
)
```
This creates an AI assistant that:
- Can search the web for current information
- Can search through your documents for relevant content
- Combines information from both sources
- Cites its sources properly

## Step 3: Running the Research Assistant üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```python
async def main():
    # Example query
    query = "Which coffee shop should I go to, taking into account my preferences and the weather today in SF?"
    
    try:
        result = await Runner.run(research_agent, query)
        print("\nResponse:")
        print(result.final_output)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nError: {e}")
        print("\nNote: To use WebSearchTool and FileSearchTool, you need:")
        print("1. Proper API keys configured")
        print("2. A valid vector store ID for FileSearchTool")
        print("3. Access to the OpenAI hosted tools")
```
This runs the research assistant with a sample question that requires:
1. Current information (today's weather in SF)
2. Personal information (your preferences, which might be in your documents)

## Step 4: Creating an Interactive Research Mode üí¨
```python
print("\n=== Interactive Research Mode ===")
print("Type 'exit' to quit")

while True:
    user_input = input("\nYou: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    
    try:
        result = await Runner.run(research_agent, user_input)
        print("\nResearch results:")
        print(result.final_output)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nError: {e}")
```
This creates an interactive mode where:
- You can ask research questions
- The AI searches the web and your documents
- It combines information to give you comprehensive answers
- You can type "exit" to quit

## Final Summary üìå
‚úÖ We created a research assistant with web search capabilities
‚úÖ We gave it access to search through our documents
‚úÖ We instructed it to combine information from multiple sources
‚úÖ We created an interactive research mode for asking questions
‚úÖ We added error handling for when the tools aren't properly configured

## Try It Yourself! üöÄ
1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   uv add openai-agents dotenv
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with your API key and vector store ID
3. Run the program:
   ```
   uv run hostedtools.py
   ```
4. Ask research questions that require current and stored information!
